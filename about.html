                    Taking a tongue-in-cheek approach to her creative process, Nicole has transformed old
                    volleyballs
                    into slippers, camera bags into bra lettes, and crafted board shorts from packets of Haribo
                    gummies.
                    This unexpected translation of materials allows her to uniquely highlight the message of
                    sustainability—a key element to her success in changing the perception around waste and
                    sustainable
                    design.

                    Workshops are also a significant focus of her work. These globally held exercises help people
                    realize the possibilities of pre-existing items and allow her to connect with people and support her
                    community.

                    Nicole is currently developing a non-profit organization that helps provide much-needed design
                    resources to young people, connecting large companies – especially those with deadstock and
                    overstock materials – to school and universities in need. She is working towards leading a regular
                    series of workshops with a continued focus on sustainability, and eventually, a summer program
                    concentrating on education and skill-based growth. The curriculum will teach you that design is more
                    than just drawing and making, but an understanding of 'how' and 'why' and what we can do to change
                    the future.
